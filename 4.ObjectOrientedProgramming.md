# Object Oriented Programming 

•	Instance variables are created when a class is initialized, we can also add properties to an instance during runtime.
•	The constructor function is invoked when a class is initialized.


# Instance Variable

```
class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    stack_list = []
```

# hasattr

Specifies whether an instance contains a certain attribute

```
class Student:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.first_name = name
    
 student1 = Student("Join")
 print(hasattr(student1, "first_name")
 print(hasattr(student1, "last_name")
 
 
 >>> 
 True
 False
 ```
 
 
# Inheritance 

passing attributes and methods from a superclass to a subclass

```
class ClassA:
  def fun(self):
    print("fun from ClassA")
    
  def coolmethod(self):
    return self.fun()
    
    
 class classB(classA):
  def fun(self):
    print("fun from ClassB")
    
  new_value = ClassB()
  
  new_value.coolmethod()
  
  ```
  output
  ```
  fun from classB
  ```
  
  
  # Polymorphism
  
  It is the ability to change the superclass behavior
  
  
  # Module Resolution Order (MRO)
  
  The way that a programming language scans through the upper part of a class's hierarchy in order to find the entity it currently needs.
